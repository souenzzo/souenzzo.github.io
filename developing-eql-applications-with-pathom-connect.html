    <h1>Developing applications with pathom connect</h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom">Pathom</a> and it's
        <a href="https://blog.wsscode.com/pathom/v2/pathom/2.2.0/connect.html">connect</a> engine brings to development
        a new way to thing about solutions</p>
    <p>Here I will describe my "problem solving" path when I'm working on REST, GraphQL and
        <a href="https://edn-query-language.org/">EQL</a> web applications.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem: Show the "Company name" on the "Tiny user card"</h2>
    <p>You are working on a regular web app where there is a UI component called "Tiny user card". It currently show the
        "user name" and a "tiny photo", like this:</p>
    <aside>
        <img alt="A small profile picture" src="me.jpg"/>
        <p>Enzzo Cavallo</p>
    </aside>
    <p>Your task is add the company name, like this:</p>
    <aside>
        <img alt="A small profile picture" src="me.jpg"/>
        <p>Enzzo Cavallo</p>
        <p>(Moleque de ideias)</p>
    </aside>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="rest-solution"> REST Solution</h2>
    <p>
        If you are using a SPA with a REST API, this component probably get it's data from a endpoint like
        <code>GET /user/42/card</code> that would return a small JSON payload like
        <code>{"id": 42, "name": "Enzzo Cavallo" "photo_url": "..."}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are a "FullStack" developer, you will will end up adding a new attribute on this <code>GET</code> to
        avoid another server interaction to render this tiny component.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h1 id="graphql-solution">GraphQL Solution</h1>
    <p>
        In a GraphQL SPA, this UI component should contain a GraphQL fragment, describing the which data it need.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add the "Company name", you will check the "GraphQL Schema" and see how to walk on the graph from User(id)
        into Company(name), then add this path to the component
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="pathom-solution">EQL/Pathom Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Like GraphQL SPA, EQL clients (usually fulcro) should have a Query within the UI Component.
        On this UI component, you should at first simply add the <code>:company/name</code> in the UI query.
        Pathom will do it's best connecting all resolvers in application and discover itself the "path" from :user/id to
        :company/name.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you see that the current resolvers aren't capable to trace a path between these attributes, you can write a
        new resolver. Probably you will connect :user/id with :company/id, then the path from :company/id to
        :company/name should already be implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the time that you request, in any UI component, a :company/name(or any other company attribute) with a
        :user/id in context, pathom will already know how to find/connect these attributes.
    </p>

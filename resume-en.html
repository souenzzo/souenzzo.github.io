            <code>2016 - 2021</code>
            <p>
                Currently working on a software that aggregates and coordinates many services from the main
                players of Brazilian e-Commerce and payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Build up from scratch an interactive e-Commerce App using AWS, Datomic Cloud, Pathom, and
                Fulcro, sharing code between Server, Web and Native targets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elaboration of a web dashboard for an long-running product, using Pathom, Fulcro, and Material UI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development of an innovative e-Commerce service, with a non-trivial distributed delivery system.
                The backend service uses Pedestal and Datomic. Despite working in the backend, I have introduced
                a simple web UI to help in debugging, administrative tasks, and analytics, using re-frame and
                Material UI. I also brought the use of AWS Services like Load Balancers and CloudFront, reducing
                the complexity of our architecture.

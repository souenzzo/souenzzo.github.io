                    <p>
                        Currently working on a software that aggregates and coordinates many services from the main
                        players of Brazilian e-Commerce and payment.

                        Development of an App using AWS, Datomic Cloud, Pathom, and Fulcro, targeting and sharing
                        code between Web and ReactNative targets.

                        A modern, reactive web app for an old (but still active) product, using
                        Pathom, Fulcro, and Material UI.

                        An innovative e-Commerce service, with a non-trivial distributed delivery system, a backend
                        service using Pedestal and Datomic. Despite working in the backend, I have introduced a simple
                        web UI to help in debugging, administrative tasks, and analytics, using re-frame and
                        Material UI. I also brought the use of AWS Services like Load Balancers and CloudFront, reducing
                        the complexity of the architecture.

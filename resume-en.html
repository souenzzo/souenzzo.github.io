                    <code>2016 - current</code>
                    <p>
                        Currently working on an eCommerce-related software that aggregates and coordinates many services
                        from the main players of Brazilian eCommerce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developed an App using AWS, Datomic Cloud, Pathom, and Fulcro, targeting and sharing
                        code between Web and ReactNative targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Developed from scratch a modern, reactive web app for an old (but still active) product, using
                        Pathom, Fulcro, and Material UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worked as a developer in an innovative eCommerce service, with a non-trivial distributed
                        delivery system. It was a backend service using Pedestal and Datomic. Despite working as a
                        backend, I introduced a simple web UI to help in debugging, administrative tasks, and analytics,
                        using re-frame and material-ui. Also introduced the use of AWS Services like Load Balancers and
                        CloudFront, reducing the complexity of the architecture.

            I'm a developer with experience in security and networks, looking for hard problems to solve involving these
            and potentially other areas.

                        Currentily working on a software that aggregates and coordinates many services from the main
                        players of Brazilian e-Commerce and payment.

                    <p>
                        Build up from scratch an interactive e-Commerce App using AWS, Datomic Cloud, Pathom, and
                        Fulcro, sharing code between Server, Web and Native targets.

                        Elaboration of a web dashboard for a long-running product, using Pathom, Fulcro, and Material
                        UI.

                    <p>
                        Development of an innovative e-Commerce service, with a non-trivial distributed delivery system.
                        The backend service uses Pedestal and Datomic. Despite working in the backend, I have introduced
                        a simple web UI to help in debugging, administrative tasks, and analytics, using re-frame and
                        Material UI. I also brought the use of AWS Services like Load Balancers and CloudFront, reducing
                        the complexity of the architecture.
